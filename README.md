Group 00 Final Project 

## Communications
Our team began communications via slack once the groups were assigned. Slack is our main form of day-to-day communications. 
We held our first group meeting on Tuesday, May 26 via zoom to get to know our team and start brainstorming ideas. We met again on Wednesday, May 27 via zoom to decide on our datasets and flush out our project.
